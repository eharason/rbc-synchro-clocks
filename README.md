## Problem 2: Synchronized Clocks

- [x] Create two synchronized clocks using <span style="color:red">React</span>
- [x] There should be the ability to adjust each clock's time.
- [x] When the time on one clock is adjusted, the time on the other clock should be automatically synchronized.
- [x] Please have 1 analog clock face and 1 digital clock face.

### Things to consider

- Please pay attention to the look and feel of the clocks as well as their functionality.
- [x] The digital clock should move as time elapses. ~~It would also be a nice to have if the analog clock does the same.~~
- Please consider writing some tests as part of the solution but complete coverage is not necessary.

## To Run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Analog Clock CSS

I was heavily inspired by the .scss in this [Analog Clock Component CodePen](https://codesandbox.io/s/analog-clock-component-yq4to?file=/src/styles.scss)
